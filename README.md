### PROFILE

I am a **Principal Software Engineer** with **15+ years** experience. When working to deliver software I believe the
following principles to be most important: **Communication**, **Transparency**, **Simplicity**,
**Separation of Concerns**, and **Agility**. I consider **Agile Delivery** with **BDD/TDD**, **CI/CD**, and
**Automation** to be the best practices for fulfilling these principles. Because of this I am dedicated to finding and 
promoting, through practice, the most effective implementations of these disciplines.
